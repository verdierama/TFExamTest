# # Ungraded Lab: Effect of Compacted Images in Training
# 
# In this notebook, you will see how reducing the target size of the generator images will affect the architecture and performance of your model. This is a useful technique in case you need to speed up your training or save compute resources. Let's begin!

# **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This notebook is designed to run as a Colab. Running it on your local machine might result in some of the code blocks throwing errors.

# As before, start downloading the train and validation sets:

# In[ ]:


# Download the training set
#get_ipython().system('wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip')


# In[ ]:


# Download the validation set
#get_ipython().system('wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/validation-horse-or-human.zip')

import requests
import os

url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/horse-or-human.zip"
local_filename = url.split('/')[-1]

# Function to download a file from a URL
def download_file(url, local_filename):
    with requests.get(url, stream=True) as r:
        r.raise_for_status()
        with open(local_filename, 'wb') as f:
            for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                f.write(chunk)
    return local_filename

# Download the file
download_file(url, local_filename)

# Unzip the file
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile(local_filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(".")

print(f"Downloaded and extracted {local_filename}")

url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course2/week3/validation-horse-or-human.zip"
local_filename = url.split('/')[-1]

# Download the file
download_file(url, local_filename)

# Unzip the file
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile(local_filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(".")

print(f"Downloaded and extracted {local_filename}")



# Then unzip them:

# In[ ]:


import zipfile

# Unzip training set
local_zip = './horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('./horse-or-human')

# Unzip validation set
local_zip = './validation-horse-or-human.zip'
zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
zip_ref.extractall('./validation-horse-or-human')

zip_ref.close()


# Then define the directories containing the images:

# In[ ]:


import os

# Directory with training horse pictures
train_horse_dir = os.path.join('./horse-or-human/horses')

# Directory with training human pictures
train_human_dir = os.path.join('./horse-or-human/humans')

# Directory with validation horse pictures
validation_horse_dir = os.path.join('./validation-horse-or-human/horses')

# Directory with validation human pictures
validation_human_dir = os.path.join('./validation-horse-or-human/humans')


# You can check that the directories are not empty and that the train set has more images than the validation set:

# In[ ]:


train_horse_names = os.listdir(train_horse_dir)
print(f'TRAIN SET HORSES: {train_horse_names[:10]}')

train_human_names = os.listdir(train_human_dir)
print(f'TRAIN SET HUMANS: {train_human_names[:10]}')

validation_horse_hames = os.listdir(validation_horse_dir)
print(f'VAL SET HORSES: {validation_horse_hames[:10]}')

validation_human_names = os.listdir(validation_human_dir)
print(f'VAL SET HUMANS: {validation_human_names[:10]}')


# In[ ]:


print(f'total training horse images: {len(os.listdir(train_horse_dir))}')
print(f'total training human images: {len(os.listdir(train_human_dir))}')
print(f'total validation horse images: {len(os.listdir(validation_horse_dir))}')
print(f'total validation human images: {len(os.listdir(validation_human_dir))}')


# ## Build the Model
# 
# The model will follow the same architecture as before but they key difference is in the `input_shape` parameter of the first `Conv2D` layer. Since you will be compacting the images later in the generator, you need to specify the expected image size here. So instead of 300x300 as in the previous two labs, you specify a smaller 150x150 array.

# In[ ]:


import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # Note the input shape is the desired size of the image 150x150 with 3 bytes color
    # This is the first convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    # The second convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    # The third convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
#     # The fourth convolution (You can uncomment the 4th and 5th conv layers later to see the effect)
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
#     # The fifth convolution
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    # Flatten the results to feed into a DNN
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    # 512 neuron hidden layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    # Only 1 output neuron. It will contain a value from 0-1 where 0 for 1 class ('horses') and 1 for the other ('humans')
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# You can see the difference from previous models when you print the `model.summary()`. As expected, there will be less inputs to the `Dense` layer at the end of the model compared to the previous labs. This is because you used the same number of max pooling layers in your model. And since you have a smaller image to begin with (150 x 150), then the output after all the pooling layers will also be smaller.

# In[ ]:


model.summary()


# You will use the same settings for training:

# In[ ]:


from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer=RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001),
              metrics=['accuracy'])


# ### Data Preprocessing
# 
# Now you will instantiate the data generators. As mentioned before, you will be compacting the image by specifying the `target_size` parameter. See the simple change below:

# In[ ]:


from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)
validation_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        './horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=128,
        # Since you used binary_crossentropy loss, you need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        './validation-horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=32,
        # Since you used binary_crossentropy loss, you need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')


# ### Training
# 
# Now you're ready to train and see the results. Note your observations about how fast the model trains and the accuracies you're getting in the train and validation sets.

# In[ ]:


history = model.fit(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=1,
      verbose=1,
      validation_data = validation_generator,
      validation_steps=8)


# ### Model Prediction
# 
# As usual, it is also good practice to try running your model over some handpicked images. See if you got better, worse, or the same performance as the previous lab.

# ## Wrap Up
# 
# In this lab, you saw how compacting images affected your previous model. This is one technique to keep in mind especially when you are still in the exploratory phase of your own projects. You can see if a smaller model behaves just as well as a large model so you can have faster training. You also saw how easy it is to customize your images for this adjustment in size by simply changing a parameter in the `ImageDataGenerator` class.
