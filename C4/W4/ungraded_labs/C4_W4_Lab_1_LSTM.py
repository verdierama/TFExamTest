# # Ungraded Lab: Using Convolutions with LSTMs
# 
# Welcome to the final week of this course! In this lab, you will build upon the RNN models you built last week and append a convolution layer to it. As you saw in previous courses, convolution filters can also capture features from sequences so it's good to try them out when exploring model architectures. Let's begin!

# ## Imports

# In[ ]:


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# ## Utilities
# 
# You will be plotting the MAE and loss later so the `plot_series()` is extended to have more labelling functionality. The utilities for generating the synthetic data is the same as the previous labs.

# ## Build the Model
# 
# Here is the model architecture you will be using. It is very similar to the last RNN you built but with the [Conv1D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv1D) layer at the input. One important [argument](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv1D#args) here is the `padding`. For time series data, it is good practice to not let computations for a particular time step to be affected by values into the future. Here is one way of looking at it:
# 
# * Let's say you have a small time series window with these values: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This means the value `1` is at `t=0`, `2` is at `t=1`, etc.
# * If you have a 1D kernel of size `3`, then the first convolution will be for the values at `[1, 2, 3]` which are values for `t=0` to `t=2`.
# * When you pass this to the first timestep of the `LSTM` after the convolution, it means that the value at `t=0` of the LSTM depends on `t=1` and `t=2` which are values into the future.
# * For time series data, you want computations to only rely on current and previous time steps.
# * One way to do that is to pad the array depending on the kernel size and stride. For a kernel size of 3 and stride of 1, the window can be padded as such: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. `1` is still at `t=0` and two zeroes are prepended to simulate values in the past.
# * This way, the first stride will be at `[0, 0, 1]` and this does not contain any future values when it is passed on to subsequent layers.
# 
# The `Conv1D` layer does this kind of padding by setting `padding=causal` and you'll see that below.

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3,
                      strides=1, padding="causal",
                      activation="relu",

model.summary()


# ## Tune the Learning Rate
# 
# In the previous labs, you are using different models for tuning and training. That is a valid approach but you can also use the same model for both. Before tuning, you can use the [`get_weights()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Layer#get_weights) method so you can reset it later.

# In[ ]:


# Get initial weights
init_weights = model.get_weights()


# After that, you can tune the model as usual.

# In[ ]:


# Set the learning rate scheduler
lr_schedule = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(
    lambda epoch: 1e-8 * 10**(epoch / 20))

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(momentum=0.9)

# Set the training parameters
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.Huber(), optimizer=optimizer)

# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_set, epochs=100, callbacks=[lr_schedule])


# In[ ]:


# Define the learning rate array
lrs = 1e-8 * (10 ** (np.arange(100) / 20))

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Set the grid
plt.grid(True)

# Plot the loss in log scale
plt.semilogx(lrs, history.history["loss"])

# Increase the tickmarks size
plt.tick_params('both', length=10, width=1, which='both')

# Set the plot boundaries
plt.axis([1e-8, 1e-3, 0, 50])


# ## Train the Model
# 
# To reset the weights, you can simply call the [`set_weights()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Layer#set_weights) and pass in the saved weights from earlier.

# In[ ]:


# Reset states generated by Keras

# In[ ]:


# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_set,epochs=500)


# Training can be a bit unstable especially as the weights start to converge so you may want to visualize it to see if it is still trending down. The earlier epochs might dominate the graph so it's also good to zoom in on the later parts of training to properly observe the parameters. The code below visualizes the `mae` and `loss` for all epochs, and also zooms in at the last 80%.

# In[ ]:


# Get mae and loss from history log
mae=history.history['mae']
loss=history.history['loss']

# Get number of epochs
epochs=range(len(loss)) 

# Plot mae and loss

# ## Wrap Up
# 
# In this lab, you were able to build and train a CNN-RNN model for forecasting. This concludes the series of notebooks on training with synthetic data. In the next labs, you will be looking at a real world time series dataset, particularly sunspot cycles. See you there!

# ## Optional - Adding a Callback for Early Stopping
# 
# In this optional section, you will add a callback to stop training when a metric is met. You already did this in the first course of this specialization and now would be a good time to review.

# First, you need to prepare a validation set that the model can use and monitor. As shown in the previous lab, you can use the `windowed_dataset()` function to prepare this.

# In[ ]:


# Generate data windows from the validation set
val_set = windowed_dataset(x_valid, window_size, batch_size, shuffle_buffer_size)


# You can reset the weights of the model or just continue from where you left off.

# In[ ]:


# Uncomment if you want to reset the weights
# model.set_weights(init_weights)


# Next, you will define a callback function that is run every end of an epoch. Inside, you will define the condition to stop training. For this lab, you will set it to stop when the `val_mae` is less than `5.2`.

# In[ ]:


class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    '''
    Halts the training when a certain metric is met

    Args:
      epoch (integer) - index of epoch (required but unused in the function definition below)
      logs (dict) - metric results from the training epoch
    '''

    if(logs.get('val_mae') < 5.2):

      # Stop if threshold is met
      print("\nRequired val MAE is met so cancelling training!")
      self.model.stop_training = True

# Instantiate the class
callbacks = myCallback()


# Remember to set an appropriate learning rate here. If you're starting from random weights, you may want to use the same rate you used earlier. If you did not reset the weights however, you can use a lower learning rate so the model can learn better. If all goes well, the training will stop before the set 500 epochs are completed.

# Set the learning rate
learning_rate = 4e-8

# Set the optimizer

# Set the training parameters
model.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.Huber(),
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=["mae"])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_set, epochs=500, validation_data=val_set, callbacks=[callbacks])


# In practice, you normally have a separate test set to evaluate against unseen data. For this exercise however, the dataset is already very small so let's just use the same validation set just to verify that the results are comparable to the one you got earlier.

# In[ ]:


# Reduce the original series

# Drop single dimensional axis
results = forecast.squeeze()

# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, results))


# The computed metrics here will be slightly different from the one shown in the training output because it has more points to evaluate. Remember that `x_valid` has 461 points that corresponds to `t=1000` to `t=1460`. `val_set` (which is a windowed dataset from `x_valid`), on the other hand, only has 441 points because it cannot generate predictions for `t=1000` to `t=1019` (i.e. windowing will start there).
