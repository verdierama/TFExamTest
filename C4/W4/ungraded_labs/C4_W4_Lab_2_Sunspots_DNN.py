# # Ungraded Lab: Predicting Sunspots with Neural Networks (DNN only)
# 
# In the remaining labs for this week, you will move away from synthetic time series and start building models for real world data. In particular, you will train on the [Sunspots](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robervalt/sunspots) dataset: a monthly record of sunspot numbers from January 1749 to July 2018. You will first build a deep neural network here composed of dense layers. This will act as your baseline so you can compare it to the next lab where you will use a more complex architecture.
# 
# Let's begin!

# ## Imports
# 
# You will use the same imports as before with the addition of the [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module. You will need this to parse the CSV file containing the dataset.

# In[ ]:


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import csv


# ## Utilities
# 
# You will only have the `plot_series()` dataset here because you no longer need the synthetic data generation functions.

# In[ ]:

    """
    Visualizes time series data

    Args:
      x (array of int) - contains values for the x-axis
      y (array of int or tuple of arrays) - contains the values for the y-axis
      format (string) - line style when plotting the graph
      label (string) - tag for the line
      start (int) - first time step to plot
      end (int) - last time step to plot
      title (string) - title of the plot
      xlabel (string) - label for the x-axis
      ylabel (string) - label for the y-axis
      legend (list of strings) - legend for the plot
    """

    # Setup dimensions of the graph figure
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

    if type(y) is tuple:

      # Loop over the y elements
      for y_curr in y:

# ## Download and Preview the Dataset
# 
# You can now download the dataset and inspect the contents. The link in class is from Laurence's repo but we also hosted it in the link below.

# In[ ]:


# Download the dataset
#get_ipython().system('wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-1-public/course4/Sunspots.csv')


# Running the cell below, you'll see that there are only three columns in the dataset:
# 1. untitled column containing the month number
# 2. Date which has the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
# 3. Mean Total Sunspot Number

# In[ ]:


# Preview the dataset
#get_ipython().system('head Sunspots.csv')


# For this lab and the next, you will only need the month number and the mean total sunspot number. You will load those into memory and convert it to arrays that represents a time series.

# In[ ]:


# Initialize lists
time_step = []
sunspots = []

# Open CSV file
with open('./Sunspots.csv') as csvfile:
  
  # Initialize reader
  reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
  
  # Skip the first line
  next(reader)
  
  # Append row and sunspot number to lists
  for row in reader:
    time_step.append(int(row[0]))
    sunspots.append(float(row[2]))

# Convert lists to numpy arrays
time = np.array(time_step)
series = np.array(sunspots)

# Preview the data
plot_series(time, series, xlabel='Month', ylabel='Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number')


# ## Split the Dataset
# 
# Next, you will split the dataset into training and validation sets. There are 3235 points in the dataset and you will use the first 3000 for training.

# ## Prepare Features and Labels
# 
# You can then prepare the dataset windows as before. The window size is set to 30 points (equal to 2.5 years) but feel free to change later on if you want to experiment.

# ## Wrap Up
# 
# In this lab, you built a relatively simple DNN to forecast sunspot numbers for a given month. We encourage you to tweak the parameters or train longer and see the best results you can get. In the next lab, you will build a more complex model and you evaluate if the added complexity translates to better or worse results.
