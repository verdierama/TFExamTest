# # Ungraded Lab: Training a Single Layer Neural Network with Time Series Data
# 
# Now that you've seen statistical methods in the previous week, you will now shift to using neural networks to build your prediction models. You will start with a simple network in this notebook and move on to more complex architectures in the next weeks. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
# 
# * build a single layer network and train it using the same synthetic data you used in the previous lab
# * prepare time series data for training and evaluation
# * measure the performance of your model against a validation set

# ## Imports
# 
# You will first import the packages you will need to execute all the code in this lab. You will use:
# * [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) to build your model and prepare data windows
# * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical processing
# * and Matplotlib's [PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) library for visualization

# In[ ]:


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# ## Utilities
# 
# You will then define some utility functions that you also saw in the previous labs. These will take care of visualizing your time series data and model predictions, as well as generating the synthetic data.

batch_size = 32
shuffle_buffer_size = 1000


# The following function contains all the preprocessing steps you did in the previous lab. This makes it modular so you can easily use it in your other projects if needed. 
# 
# One thing to note here is the `window_size + 1` when you call `dataset.window()`. There is a `+ 1` to indicate that you're taking the next point as the label. For example, the first 20 points will be the feature so the 21st point will be the label.

# You can again inspect the output to see if the function is behaving as expected. The code below will use the [`take()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#take) method of the `tf.data.Dataset` API to grab a single batch. It will then print several properties of this batch such as the data type and shape of the elements. As expected, it should have a 2-element tuple (i.e. `(feature, label)`) and the shapes of these should align with the batch and window sizes you declared earlier which are `32` and `20` by default, respectively.

# ## Build and compile the model
# 
# Next, you will build the single layer neural network. This will just be a one-unit [Dense](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/dense/) layer as shown below. You will assign the layer to a variable `l0` so you can also look at the final weights later using the [`get_weights()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Layer#get_weights) method.

# In[ ]:


# Build the single layer neural network
l0 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=[window_size])
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([l0])

# Print the initial layer weights
print("Layer weights: \n {} \n".format(l0.get_weights()))

# Print the model summary
model.summary()


# You will set [*mean squared error (mse)*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/MeanSquaredError) as the loss function and use [*stochastic gradient descent (SGD)*](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD) to optimize the weights during training.

# In[ ]:


# Set the training parameters
model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1e-6, momentum=0.9))


# ## Train the Model
# 
# Now you can proceed to train your model. You will feed in the prepared data windows and run the training for 100 epochs.

# In[ ]:


# Train the model
model.fit(dataset,epochs=100)


# You can see the final weights by again calling the `get_weights()` method.

# In[ ]:


# Print the layer weights
print("Layer weights {}".format(l0.get_weights()))


# ## Model Prediction
# 
# With the training finished, you can now measure the performance of your model. You can generate a model prediction by passing a batch of data windows. If you will be slicing a window from the original `series` array, you will need to add a batch dimension before passing it to the model. That can be done by indexing with the [`np.newaxis`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html?highlight=newaxis#numpy.newaxis) constant or using the [`np.expand_dims()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html) method.

# In[ ]:


# Shape of the first 20 data points slice
print(f'shape of series[0:20]: {series[0:20].shape}')

# Shape after adding a batch dimension
print(f'shape of series[0:20][np.newaxis]: {series[0:20][np.newaxis].shape}')

# Shape after adding a batch dimension (alternate way)
print(f'shape of series[0:20][np.newaxis]: {np.expand_dims(series[0:20], axis=0).shape}')

# Sample model prediction
print(f'model prediction: {model.predict(series[0:20][np.newaxis])}')


# To compute the metrics, you will want to generate model predictions for your validation set. Remember that this set refers to points at index `1000` to `1460` of the entire series. You will need to code the steps to generate those from your model. The cell below demonstrates one way of doing that. 
# 
# Basically, it feeds the entire series to your model 20 points at a time and append all results to a `forecast` list. It will then slice the points that corresponds to the validation set. 
# 
# The slice index below is `split_time - window_size:` because the forecast list is smaller than the series by 20 points (i.e. the window size). Since the window size is 20, the first data point in the `forecast` list corresponds to the prediction for time at index `20`. You cannot make predictions at index `0` to `19` because those are smaller than the window size. Thus, when you slice with `split_time - window_size:`, you will be getting the points at the time indices that aligns with those in the validation set.
# 
# *Note: You might notice that this cell takes a while to run. In the next two labs, you will see other approaches to generating predictions to make the code run faster. You might already have some ideas and feel free to try them out after completing this lab.*

# In[ ]:


# Initialize a list
forecast = []

# Use the model to predict data points per window size
for time in range(len(series) - window_size):
  forecast.append(model.predict(series[time:time + window_size][np.newaxis]))

# Slice the points that are aligned with the validation set
forecast = forecast[split_time - window_size:]

# Compare number of elements in the predictions and the validation set
print(f'length of the forecast list: {len(forecast)}')
print(f'shape of the validation set: {x_valid.shape}')


# To visualize the results, you will need to convert the predictions to a form that the `plot_series()` utility function accepts. That involves converting the list to a numpy array and dropping the single dimensional axes.

# In[ ]:


# Preview shapes after using the conversion and squeeze methods
print(f'shape after converting to numpy array: {np.array(forecast).shape}')
print(f'shape after squeezing: {np.array(forecast).squeeze().shape}')

# Convert to a numpy array and drop single dimensional axes
results = np.array(forecast).squeeze()

# Overlay the results with the validation set
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, results))


# You can compute the metrics by calling the same functions as before. You will get an MAE close to 5.

# In[ ]:


# Compute the metrics
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(x_valid, results).numpy())
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, results).numpy())


# ## Wrap Up
# 
# In this lab, you were able to build and train a single layer neural network on time series data. You prepared data windows, fed them to the model, and the final predictions show comparable results with the statistical analysis you did in Week 1. In the next labs, you will try adding more layers and will also look at some optimizations you can make when training your model.
