# # Ungraded Lab: Statistical Forecasting on Synthetic Data
# 
# In this lab, you will be doing some statistical forecasting so you can compare it with the machine learning models you will build later on. 

# ## Imports
# 
# You will first import the packages you will need to execute all the code in this lab. You will use:
# * [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) to build your model and prepare data windows
# * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical processing
# * and Matplotlib's [PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) library for visualization

# In[ ]:


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# ## Utilities
# 
# You will then define some utility functions to make the code more organized. First up is the plotting function you also used in the previous lab.

# In[ ]:

# 
# You can then use the utility functions above to generate the synthetic data. This will start at a baseline then trend upwards with a seasonal pattern every 365 steps. You will also add some noise because real world data is often noisy as well.

#

# Get the validation set

# You can inspect these sets visually by using the same utility function for plotting. Notice that in general, the validation set has higher values (i.e. y-axis) than those in the training set. Your model should be able to predict those values just by learning from the trend and seasonality of the training set.

# In[ ]:


# Plot the train set

# In[ ]:


# Plot the validation set
plot_series(time_valid, x_valid)


# # Naive Forecast
# 
# As a baseline, you can do a naive forecast where you assume that the next value will be the same as the previous time step. You can slice the original series like below and print some values as a sanity check. The next time step value should be identical to the ground truth at the previous time step.

# In[ ]:


# Generate the naive forecast
naive_forecast = series[split_time - 1:-1]

# Define time step
time_step = 100

# Print values
print(f'ground truth at time step {time_step}: {x_valid[time_step]}')
print(f'prediction at time step {time_step + 1}: {naive_forecast[time_step + 1]}')


# You can see this visually with the `plot_series()` function you defined earlier.

# In[ ]:


# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, naive_forecast))


# You can zoom in at the start of the validation period to see that the naive forecast lags 1 step behind the time series.

# In[ ]:


# Zooming in

# ### Computing Metrics
# 
# Now you will compute the [mean squared error](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/mean_squared_error) and the [mean absolute error](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/mean_absolute_error) between the forecasts and the predictions in the validation period. These are available via the [`tf.keras.metrics`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/) API. 

# In[ ]:


print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(x_valid, naive_forecast).numpy())
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, naive_forecast).numpy())


# The values above will be your baseline and you will see if you can use other methods to do better than naive forecasting.

# ## Moving Average
# 
# One technique you can use is to do a moving average. This sums up a series of time steps and the average will be the prediction for the next time step. For example, the average of the measurements at time steps 1 to 10 will be the forecast for time step 11, then the average for time steps 2 to 11 will be the forecast for time step 12, and so on.
# 
# The function below does the moving average for the entire `series`. It takes a `window_size` argument to indicate the number of time steps to consider when computing the mean.

# In[ ]:


def moving_average_forecast(series, window_size):
    """Generates a moving average forecast

    Args:
      series (array of float) - contains the values of the time series
      window_size (int) - the number of time steps to compute the average for

    Returns:
      forecast (array of float) - the moving average forecast
    """

    # Initialize a list
    forecast = []
    
    # Compute the moving average based on the window size
    for time in range(len(series) - window_size):
      forecast.append(series[time:time + window_size].mean())
    
    # Convert to a numpy array
    forecast = np.array(forecast)

    return forecast


# You will use this function to generate the forecast with a window size of `30`.

# In[ ]:


# Generate the moving average forecast
moving_avg = moving_average_forecast(series, 30)[split_time - 30:]

# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, moving_avg))


# In[ ]:


# Compute the metrics
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(x_valid, moving_avg).numpy())
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, moving_avg).numpy())


# That's worse than naive forecast! The moving average does not anticipate trend or seasonality. In particular, those huge spikes in the original series causes big deviations as shown in the plot above. You will try to remove these characteristics of the dataset with time differencing and see if you get better results.

# ## Differencing
# 
# Since the seasonality period is 365 days, you will subtract the value at time *t* – 365 from the value at time *t*. That is done with the code below. 
# 
# In addition, you will need to align the result with the `time` array. Since you can only do time differencing for `t >= 365`, you will need to truncate the first 365 time steps of the `time` array.
# 
# You can plot the result to visualize the values.

# In[ ]:


# Subtract the values at t-365 from original series
diff_series = (series[365:] - series[:-365])

# Truncate the first 365 time steps
diff_time = time[365:]

# Plot the results
plot_series(diff_time, diff_series)


# Great! The trend and seasonality seem to be gone so now you can retry using the moving average. `diff_series` is the ground truth while `diff_moving_avg` is the prediction array. You will slice these accordingly to correspond to the validation set time steps before comparing.

# In[ ]:


# Generate moving average from the time differenced dataset
diff_moving_avg = moving_average_forecast(diff_series, 30)

# Slice the prediction points that corresponds to the validation set time steps
diff_moving_avg = diff_moving_avg[split_time - 365 - 30:]

# Slice the ground truth points that corresponds to the validation set time steps
diff_series = diff_series[split_time - 365:]

# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (diff_series, diff_moving_avg))


# Now you will bring bring back the trend and seasonality by adding the past values from `t – 365`:

# In[ ]:


# Add the trend and seasonality from the original series
diff_moving_avg_plus_past = series[split_time - 365:-365] + diff_moving_avg

# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_past))


# In[ ]:


print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_past).numpy())
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_past).numpy())


# It is a bit better than naive forecast. However, the forecasts look a bit too random because you're adding past values which are already noisy. Remember that the time differenced signal is also noisy so adding these raw past values can compound this problem. To remedy that, you can use a moving averaging on past values to smooth out some of this noise.

# ## Smoothing
# 
# You can use the same `moving_average_forecast()` function to smooth out past values before adding them back to the time differenced moving average. There are two ways to do this:
# 
# * Trailing windows - This refers to getting the mean of past values to smooth out the value at the current time step. For example, getting the average of `t=0` to `t=6` to get the smoothed data point at **`t=6`**.
# 
# * Centered windows - This refers to getting the mean of past *and future* values to smooth out the value at the current time step. For example, getting the average of `t=0` to `t=6` to get the smoothed data point at **`t=3`**.
# 
# The code below will use the centered windows approach and you will notice it in the slicing of the `series` array. It is shifted by `370` steps and the window size is `11`. To get the smooth data point at `t=1000` (i.e. start of the validation set), it will average the measurements at `t=995` to `t=1005`.

# In[ ]:


# Smooth the original series before adding the time differenced moving average
diff_moving_avg_plus_smooth_past = moving_average_forecast(series[split_time - 370:-359], 11) + diff_moving_avg

# Plot the results
plot_series(time_valid, (x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_smooth_past))


# The metrics will show a big improvement over the previous output.

# In[ ]:


# Compute the metrics
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_squared_error(x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_smooth_past).numpy())
print(tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, diff_moving_avg_plus_smooth_past).numpy())


# ## Wrap Up
# 
# This concludes a short exploration of statistical methods for time series forecasting. In the next labs, you will build neural networks for forecasting and see if you get comparable results to the techniques you just used in this lab.
